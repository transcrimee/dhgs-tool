Hello I'm **Nora** (@transcrime), the main maintainer of **LiveChatPython**. Thank you for taking the time to contribute! To keep the project maintainable and easy for everyone to understand, please follow these guidelines:

### 🏗️ Code Quality & Style
- **Readability:** Do not have a complete unreadable code Beyond. 
-  **Naming Conventions:** Check your spelling and grammar when it comes to  `functions` or  `def` and  variable names. 
- **Documentation:** keep your code as well documented and cite it for future people.

### 🌱 Pull Request (PR) Rules
- **Atomic PRs:**  Submit an individual pull request for each separate suggestion or fix. Do not bundle multiple unrelated changes into one PR.
-  **Descriptive Titles:** The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- **Mandatory Comments:** Pull Requests without a personal comment **will not be accepted** until one is added.
